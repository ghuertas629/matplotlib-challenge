Observations

1. There is a high positive correlation (0.84) between mouse weight and average tumor volume in the population of mice that were treated with the drug Capomulin.

2. Infubinol was the only promising drug that had any mice whose final tumor volume was considered an outlier based on the distribution.

3. Ramicane's tumor volume mean and median are the most similar out of any of the drugs in the study meaning its distribution is closest to being symmetric.
